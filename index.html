I was so proud of it and i started trying to make more elaborate types of food, and i mastered the art of cooking. I still have some things to learn but i can say i am pretty great at it and i occasionally bring food to Nick to help us focus on our work.</p>

I remember back then I was upset by the fact that I was among the shortest in my team :) Not many things have changed since, except the fact that my technique has become way better than it was.</p>
